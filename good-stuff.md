A group of researchers from Clemson University achieved a remarkable milestone while studying topic modeling, an important component of machine learning associated with natural language processing, breaking the record for creating the largest high-performance cluster in the cloud by using more than 1,100,000 vCPUs on Amazon EC2 Spot Instances running in a single AWS region.

### A Day in the Life of a Billion Packets: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd5hsL-JNY4 This is the first version of this talk. It’s still my favorite. It is from re:Invent and explains what is happening "under the hood" inside a VPC. This is a "must watch" for anyone that does any sort of work with infrastructure.

https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/the-netflix-simian-army-16e57fbab116 Netflix has a host of tools that they’ve open sourced over the years. My favorite is Conformity Monkey. I think rules make for a well-ordered society.

### Building Apps for Mobile, Gaming, IoT, and more using AWS DynamoDB by Rick Houlihan: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNFRTnp9Qh4 This talk was given at Harvard as part of their CS50 class. I think it has everything anyone needs to know about stepping into relational and non-relational databases. I’ve never watched it all in one sitting. I usually stop it to make some notes and wrap my head around what he says. It’s great!
